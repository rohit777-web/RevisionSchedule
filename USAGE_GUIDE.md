## üìÖ Revision Schedule

The system uses scientifically-proven spaced repetition:

| Revision | Interval | Example Timeline |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| 1st | 1 day | Learn today ‚Üí Revise tomorrow |
| 2nd | 7 days | After 1 week |
| 3rd | 15 days | After 2+ weeks |
| 4th | 30 days | After 1 month |
| 5th | 90 days | After 3 months |
| 6th | 180 days | After 6 months |
| 7th+ | 180 days | Every 6 months |

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Daily Check**: Review due topics every day
2. **Mark Promptly**: Mark revisions as soon as you complete them
3. **Stay Consistent**: Small daily sessions work better than cramming
4. **Export Data**: Use CSV/Excel export to print physical schedules
5. **Use Demo**: Run option 9 to see how it works with sample data
